# LMStudio OCR Table Formatting Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes implemented for the LMStudio OCR table formatting issues.

## Problem

The LMStudio OCR processor was outputting tables with data arranged vertically in a single column instead of properly organizing each compound into a horizontal row. This made the data difficult to read and analyze.

## Solution

1. **Enhanced Detection**: Improved the detection of LMStudio's characteristic vertical bar pattern with a more flexible matching approach.

2. **Simplified Parser**: Completely rewrote the table parsing logic to reliably extract data from LMStudio's vertical output format and reorganize it into proper horizontal rows.

3. **Updated Prompts**: Enhanced the system prompts and OCR prompts to emphasize proper row structure with explicit examples.

4. **Multiple Detection Methods**: Implemented multiple fallback approaches to ensure various output formats can be properly parsed.

## Files Modified

- `/processors/lmstudio_modules/table_formatter.py` - Enhanced table formatting logic to handle LMStudio's vertical output
- `/processors/lmstudio_modules/client.py` - Updated prompts to emphasize proper row structure
- `/processors/lmstudio_modules/image_processor.py` - Added direct detection of LMStudio's vertical bar pattern
- `/processors/lmstudio_modules/parallel_processor.py` - Applied consistent post-processing for parallel page processing

## Testing

The fix has been tested with sample LMStudio outputs, successfully converting vertical data into properly formatted horizontal rows. The tests show that the implementation can correctly:

1. Detect LMStudio's unique output pattern
2. Extract data values from the vertical format
3. Group related data into compound entries
4. Generate a properly formatted markdown table with each compound in its own row

## Usage

No changes are required to use this fix. The improved table formatter is automatically applied when processing documents with LMStudio. The fix maintains backward compatibility with other output formats while specifically addressing LMStudio's vertical format issue.
